#### üëã Welcome

This book centralizes all cybersecurity offensive tactics and techniques I discovered from challenges, trainings, certifications and real life engagements. It is my personal notebook I use daily, but I decided to turn it public to give back to the InfoSec community what I learnt from it.

I built this book as a mix between a wiki and a mind-map. Simply [follow links](/docs/index.html#-lets-start) depending on what you want to achieve.

Enjoy your reading!

#### üõë Before you start

Tactics and techniques described in this book leverage dozens of open-source tools. Despite that I try to link each tool to its official source every time, it could be painful to manually download each tool one by one.

That's why I propose you to deploy my [Kalice](https://github.com/ky4meru/Kalice) Ansible playbook, which automatically install everything you will need on you Kali Linux environment!

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ky4meru/Kalice.git
sudo apt install -y ansible
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Let's start

Go on the page corresponding to your **target**:

- [Active Directory domain](/docs/active-directory/index.html) like `target.local`
- [Azure tenant](/azure/) like `target.onmicrosoft.com`
- [Domain name](/network/) like `*.target.com`
- [Linux host](/docs/linux/index.html) like `target`
- [Network range](/network/) like `10.0.0.0/8`
- [People](/osint/) like `John Doe from Target & Co.`
- [Web application](/webapps/) like `https://app.target.com/`
- [Windows host](/docs/windows/index.html) like `TARGET`
