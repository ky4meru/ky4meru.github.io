# Unquoted Service Paths
---

## Vulnerability

Windows services are basically executables that are automatically run by the system. They are configured with a path. If this path contains spaces that are not quoted, the operating system will interpret them as terminator characters. For instance, given the unquoted path `C:\Program Files\My Folder\Hello World.exe`, Windows will try to run in the order:

1. `C:\Program.exe`
2. `C:\Program Files\My.exe`
3. `C:\Program Files\My Folder\Hello.exe`
4. `C:\Program Files\My Folder\Hello World.exe`

If you have permissions to create an executable in one of the 3 first paths, you could execute whatever you want to escalate your privileges on the system.

## Prerequisites

* Low privileged access to the targeted system.

## Exploit

First, you need to identified services with unquoted paths that could be exploited.

```powershell
# Enumerate service paths using wmic.
wmic service get name, pathname

# Enumerate running services using native PowerShell.
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select-Object Name, State, PathName | Where-Object {$รง.State -like 'Running'}
```

If you're too lazy - *and I know you are* -, you can use [SharpUp](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp) or [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) to automatically enumerate unquoted service paths that can be exploited.

```powershell
.\SharpUp.exe audit UnquotedServicePath
.\WinPEAS.exe
```

Once identified, you need to check if you have the correct permissions to drop a payload in either of possible paths.

```powershell
Get-Acl -Path "C:\Program Files\My Folder" | Format-List
```

If a group you belongs to has necessary permissions - i.e. *CreateFiles* or *FullControl* - to drop an executable, you can perform the attack. Once your executable in place, you can either restart the associated process - *if you are local administrator* - or wait for a system reboot.

## Recommendations

- [ ] Quote Windows service paths with spaces.
